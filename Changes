Revision history for Perl extension Text-Markup.

0.18

     - Rest support now uses its own implementation of `rst2html` so that it
       can render specialized reST documents, such as Sphinx files, in a more
       forgiving way: it preserves the content of unknown directives while not
       emulating specialized rendering. Written by Daniele Varrazzo.
     - Improved handling of Sphinx directives in Rest output. Most directives
       are stripped out, although `function` directives now turn out much
       nicer. Props to Daniele Varrazzo for the work on the Rest parser.
     - Fixed character encoding issues with the Rest parser.
     - Fixed a character encoding issue in the test suite.

      - Changed the parsers to return `undef` if no content was parsed from a
        file.
