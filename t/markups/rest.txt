=====================
I am a reST document
=====================
And I am its subtitle
=====================

Rest__ allows *inline* **style** and other stuff,
but I guess this ``code`` is enough.

.. __: https://docutils.sourceforge.io

.. unknown:: arg1 arg2
    :option: foo

    We also support unknown directive, so that no content is lost if reST
    specialization is parsed.

Of course we may also find :unknown:`new roles`.

.. module:: mymodule

    This is a module that doesn't *exist*

    .. function:: foo()

        In Sphinx documentation you could find this stuff.

.. toctree::

    we
    dont
    care

.. code-block:: python

    print "I have no title"
